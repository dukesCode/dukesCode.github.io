Hey, this github page is actually working! Managed to write all the HTML/CSS with what remains of my highschool
"Programming" class skills, and a lot of help from [Johnathan McGlone's guide on setting up a github Pages site](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Thank you so much for the easy to follow guide, it was a great refresher on
how to HTML.

I'm hoping to use this site to document all my current, past, and future projects. I'll keep you all posted!

Cheers!

Jean-Luc
